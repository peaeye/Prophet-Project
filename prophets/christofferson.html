        <h1>D. Todd Christofferson</h1>

        <p>
            D. Todd Christofferson is currently the 9th Senior Apostle in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
            He was born on January 24, 1945 in American Fork, UT.
            When he was young, his father was serving in China, so he lived with his maternal grandparents for 18
            months.
            His mother had to undergo radical cancer surgery and for a while, it was very painful for his mother to use
            her right arm.
            His father bought a machine to that could help people iron without the heavy use of their arms.
            His mother was very upset, wondering how they could ever pay for it, when his father revealed that he had
            gone without money for a year to save up the money to buy this machine.
            His father was a great example to him.
        </p>
        <p>
            After graduating high school, D. Todd Christofferson went to BYU for one year before leaving on his mission
            to Argentina.
            After returning from his mission, he got his Bachelor's in English from BYU and a law degree from Duke
            University.
            After getting his law degree, he became a law clerk to Judge Sirica, who absolutely praised Christofferson
            and even called a law firm who wanted Christofferson: "I can't let Todd go. He's too valuable."
        </p>
        <p>
            D. Todd Christofferson first met Kathy Jacob at the BYU Football Stadium.
            They never talked to each other, but each were deeply impressed with the other.
            Talk about missed oppurtunity.
            Fortunately, months later, he found out her name through the yearbook, found out his roommate knew her, and
            arranged a blind date with her.
            One thing led to another, and by May 28, 1968, they were married in the Salt Lake Temple.
            They have five children, four sons and one daughter.
        </p>
        <p>
            On April 5, 2008, he was called to be a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
