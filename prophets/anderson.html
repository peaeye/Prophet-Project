        <p>
            Neil L. Andersen is currently the 10th Senior Apostle in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
            He was born on August 9, 1951 in Logan, UT.
            He grew up rural area, which was a blessing; it taught him a lot of valuable life lessons.
            For example, he had a pet rabbit when he was young.
            One day, it got lost and he was worried the neighborhood cats and dogs would get to it before he could.
            So he knelt down and prayed, and soon, he found the rabbit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Neil L. Andersen was a very hard worker.
            He did some cross-country in high school, but he also was a student body governer.
            At BYU, he woke up at 4am everyday for his job.
            On his mission to France, he burned holes through his shoes due to the amount of walking he was doing.
            After graduating from BYU, he earned a master's in Business Administration at Harvard.
            He ran an ad agency business, but also dabbled in real estate and health care.
        </p>
        <p>
            When he was student body vice president at BYU, he met a certain Kathy Williams.
            She was a campaigner for his campaign.
            They got married in the Salt Lake Temple on March 20, 1975.
            After he got his master's at Harvard, they moved to Tampa, Florida.
            They have 2 boys and 2 girls.
            As a family, they had to move a lot, which put undue stress on the kids.
            Neil said that Kathy was the glue that held the family together during those times.
        </p>
        <p>
            On April 4, 2009, he was sustained as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
