        <p>
            Russell M. Nelson is currently the 17th prophet of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
            He was born on September 9, 1924 in Salt Lake City as the second of four children.
            His parents were not active members, but they still allowed him to choose for himself whether
            to go to Sunday School or not.
            He choose to go.
            His devotion eventually led to his siblings all being baptized in 1940 and his parents eventually became
            active again.
            One funny example of his devotion that usually comes up when talking about his youth was
            that when he learned about the word of wisdom, he smashed all the bottles of alcohol that his parents had.
        </p>
        <p>
            When he was 15, he decided that he wanted to be a physician, since he wanted to serve people.
            He graduated from East High at 16 and entered into the University of Utah in Medicine.
            While in University of Utah, he was pressured to be in a play because of his amazing singing.
            While in this play, he met Dantzel White.
            He was smitten at first glance and three years later, he was married to her.
        </p>
        <p>
            He served as an army medic during the Korean war.
            After the war, he got his PhD. from the University of Minnesota and got even more training in surgical
            practices at Harvard Medical School Massachusetts General Hospital.
            As a heart surgeon, he did many great things for the world.
            He aided in the development of the first artificial heart-lung machine.
            He performed many thousands of heart surgeries, including the first open heart surgery in Utah.
        </p>
        <p>
            He became a member of the Quorom of the Twelve Apostles on April 7, 1984.
            He was sustained as the President and Prophet on January 18, 2018.
