        <p>
            Ronald A. Rasband is currently the 11th Senior Apostle in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
            He was born on Febuary 6, 1951 in Salt Lake City.
            His parents had been divorced and remarried before they had him.
            His family was never well off financially, but he said "it never affected my happiness."
            He never really had time for school activities because he was working hard to support his family.
        </p>
        <p>
            He had hoped to go on a mission to Germany like his brothers did, but was sorely disappointed when he got
            called to New York.
            He wanted to know why, so he opened to a random page of the Doctrine and Covenants.
            Lo and behold, there was his answer in D&C 100:2-3,5.
            After coming home from his mission, he attended the University of Utah.
            However, before he graduated, Jon Huntsman wanted him to be the new account manager at his company.
            He fell into a sort friend-mentor relation with Mr. Huntsman.
            Eventually, he became the President and COO of the global Huntsman Chemical Corporation, all without
            graduating college.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shortly after entering into the U of U, he met Melanie Twitchell.
            They were actually dating other people when first met, but they became good friends still.
            One day, Elder Rasband jokingly suggested that they go out because they were such good friends.
            Sister Twitchell immediately turned around, put her hand on his shoulder, and set up the date.
            A year later, in 1973, they were married in the Salt Lake Temple.
            They have five kids.
        </p>
        <p>
            On October 3, 2015, he was set apart as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
