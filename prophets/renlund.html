        <p>
            Dale G. Renlund is currently the 13th Senior Apostle in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
            He was born on November 13, 1952 in Salt Lake City, UT.
            His Mother and Father came from Sweden and Finland, respectively.
            They met at church in Stockholm, Sweden, but there was no temple there at the time.
            Being faithful members, they went all the way to Utah to get married in the temple.
            Dale G. Renlund grew up in a very faithful family setting; his father was a building missionary, and his
            brother was influential in helping him read and study the Book of Mormon.
        </p>
        <p>
            He was called to serve on the Sweden Mission.
            After returning from his mission, he went to University of Utah to get his bachelor's in Chemistry.
            Then he received further training at John Hopkins Hospital.
            After his training, he returned to the U of U to become a professor of medicine.
            He was also the medical director of the Utah Transplantation Affiliated Hospitals Cardiac Transplant
            Program.
        </p>
        <p>
            He met his wife, Ruth Lybbert, in a his local ward.
            He admits he was a horrible dater, but fortunately for him, they got married on June 16th 1977 in the Salt
            Lake Temple.
            They have one daughter.
            Unfortunately, Sister Renlund suffered ovarian cancer and had to undergo surgery and chemotherapy.
            This left her unable to have any more children, but they still thanked God for the blessing that was their
            only daughter.
        </p>
        <p>
            On October 3, 2015, he called to serve as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
