            Dieter F. Uchtdorf is currently the 6th Senior Apostle of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
            He was born on November 6, 1940 in Ostrava, Czechoslovakia.
            His father was drafted into the German army during WW2; his mother struggled to take care 4 children by
            herself during
            a time of strife.
            Soon, in winter of 1944, they decided to move to the Western Front of Germany as the threat of
            Soviet invasion got closer and closer.
            They settled down in Zwickau, Germany getting converted to the church there, but had to move again
            as it went under Soviet jurisdiction.
            After a harrowing journey, the finally settled down in Frankfurt, Germany, poor but free and safe.
            He got a job as a laundry delivery boy to support his family, which helped cure him of a lung disease in his
            youth.

            While living in West Germany, he had to learn English, but he wasn't very good at it.
            However, he had dreams of becoming a pilot, but one of the requirements of being a pilot is knowing how to
            speak english.
            After this revelation, he suddenly had no more troubles with learning English!
            He started his flight career with an engineering education, followed by 6 years in the German Air Force,
            then he was transferred to a fighter pilot school in Texas.
            After his fighter pilot training, he worked for Lufthansa Airlines until 1996, flying many sorts of planes.

            In Frankfurt, a pair of missionaries converted a young Harriet Reich and her family.
            When she walked in their branch's sacrament meeting, Dieter Uchtdorf was immediately smittem.
            Although many young men were heads over heels for her, Uchtdorf did not give up.
            Even after serving in the German Air force and in the US, he still pursued her when he came back to
            Frankfurt.
            He impressed her with his humbleness and maturity and won her over that way.
            In 1962, they were married in the Swiss Temple, where his parents were sealed many years ago.
            They have two kids, one son and one daughter.

            On October 2, 2004, he was called as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
            On Febuary 3, 2008, he was set apart as the Second Counselor in the First Presidency under President Thomas
            S. Monson.
            In 2018, he returned to being on the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
