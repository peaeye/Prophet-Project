        <p>Henry B. Eyring is currently the Second Counselor of the First Presidency.
            He was born on May 31, 1933 in Princeton, New Jersey, as the second of three sons.
            His home ward was very small and their branch often met in the Eyrings home for Chruch.
            In fact, he and his brothers constituted the entire membership of the Aaron priesthood in their branch.
            Eventually, the Eyrings moved to Utah and Henry B. Eyring graduated from East High.
        </p>
        <p>
            He went to study Physics at the University of Utah because his father would pay for his tuitions if he did
            so.
            However, Henry B. Eyring was not a physics guy and struggled more than his father expected.
            His father then told him, "'Hal, I
            think you'd better get out of physics. You ought to
            find something that you love"
            He finished his bachelor's in physics, but went to Harvard as a Business Administration major, completing
            both his Masters and his doctorates there.
        </p>
        <p>
            After graduating, he became an assistant professor at Stanford.
            Just before moving to California, he met Kathleen Johnson.
            The two hit it off, and soon, they were married in the temple, by Spencer W. Kimball, no less.
            Henry B. Eyring was a very faithful member, even dropping his comfortable life as a professor at Stanford
            to become the president of small Ricks College in Idaho at the request of Neal A. Maxwell.
        </p>
        <p>
            On April 1, 1995, Henry B. Eyring was sustained as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
            In 2007, he got called to be the second counselor of Gordon B. Hinckley.
            After, he was the first counselor of Thomas S. Monson, and the second counselor of Russell M. Nelson.
