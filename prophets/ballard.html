        <p>
            M. Russell Ballard is currently the 87th Apostle of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
            He was born on October 8, 1928 in Salt Lake City.
            His paternal grandfather was Apostle Melvin J. Ballard. His Maternal grandfather was Hyrum Mack Smith.
            He was a very faithful young man, becoming the president of seminary at East High.
            At the University of Utah, he was called "the bishop" by his fraternity brothers because of his
            faithfulness.
        </p>
        <p>
            He served a mission to the British Isles.
            When he graduated, he operated many businesses, including automotive, real estates, and investment.
            He took over his Father's Ballard Motor company in 1956.
            In 1976, he was called to be the president of the Canada Toronto mission.
        </p>
        <p>
            After returning from his mission, he happened to attend a dance.
            During the event, he danced with Barbara Bowen for thirty seconds.
            During those 30 seconds, he got the distinct impression that she was the one meant for him.
            Unfortunately, she didn't quite see eye to eye with him.
            Fortunately, as a salesman, he was able to win her over.
            They got married in 1951 and had 2 sons and 5 daughters.
        </p>
        <p>
            On October 6, 1985, he was called to be a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
            Currently, he is the acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
