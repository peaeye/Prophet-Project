        <p>
            Jeffrey R. Holland is currently the 4th Senior Apostle of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
            He was born on December 3rd, 1940 and raised in St George, UT.
            His mother said he was a very obedient young boy.
            In high school, he was a huge sports guy, playing basketball, football, track, and baseball.
            He helped his high school team win the basketball and football state championships.
        </p>
        <p>
            While playing on his high school teams, he met a certain cheerleader: Patricia Terry.
            He liked her, she liked him; everything was going along great except for one thing, she really wanted him to
            go on a mission.
            So he did.
            After he came back from his mission, they made it official and married in 1963.
            They have two sons and one daughter.
        </p>
        <p>
            As was stated, he went on a mission to Britain.
            However, he was not in the best financial place and Britain was one of the costlier missions.
            However, when he returned home, expecting an empty bank account, he was suprised to find everything still
            there.
            His parents had sacrificed a lot financially to pay for his mission.
            He got his bachelor's in English at BYU and master's in Religious Instruction.
            He then got his doctorate's at Yale in American Studies.
            In 1974, he became the Dean of Religious Education at BYU and in 1980, he became the President of BYU for 9
            years.
        </p>
        <p>
            On June 23, 1994, he was sustained as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
