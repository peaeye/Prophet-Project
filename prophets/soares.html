        <p>
            Ulisses Soares is currently the 15th Senior Apostle in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
            He was born on October 2, 1958 in S達o Paulo, Brazil.
            His parent were originally non-members, but his aunt sent the missionaries to them, and by the time Ulisses
            was 6, they had joined the church.
            When he was 11 years old, his bishop had him come in for an interview.
            Imagine his suprise when, at the end of the interview, his bishop took out mission call papers and
            challenged young Ulisses to fill them out.
            There are multiple examples just like this that show just how faithful he was.
            When he was a teenager, he got a job at a company preparing its payroll.
            After he started studying accounting, he was transferred to the company's accounting department.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using the money he earned by working, he slowly saved up money to go on a mission.
            He served in the Brazil Rio de Janeiro mission.
            Education wise, he earned a bachelor's in accounting and economics at the S達o Paulo Pontifical Catholic
            University.
            After, he earned his MBA at the National Institute of Postgraduate Study.
            Professionally, he worked as an accountant and auditor for multiple multinational corporations in Brazil.
        </p>
        <p>
            He first met Rosana Fernandes Morgado on his mission.
            At first, Ulisses was engaged to somebody else, but cancelled the engagement when the spirit told him that
            Rosana was his fated one.
            Ulisses was very dedicated to pursuing Rosana, traveling all the way across S達o Paulo every week to see her.
            They were married on October 30, 1982 at the S達o Paulo Temple.
            She originally struggled to have children, but after a good reference to a doctor from another member and
            mulitple surgeries, she was able to bear one son and two daughters. 
        </p>
        <p>
            On March 31, 2018, he was sustained as a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
