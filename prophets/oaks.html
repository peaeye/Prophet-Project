        <h1>Dallin H. Oaks</h1>
        <img

        <p>
            Dallin H. Oaks is currently the First Counselor of the First Presidency.
            He was born in Provo, but he spent most of his early life in Twin Falls, Idaho.
            Unfortunately, when he was 7, his father died.
            His mother hit particularly hard, so Dallin and his siblings were sent to live with their grandparents.
            During this troubling period in his life, Dallin personally struggled with many things including school.
            Eventually, his mother recovered mentally and his family moved to Vernal, UT.
            This was a turning point in his life, when the troubling times ended and Dallin could refocus on his
            schoolwork.
        </p>
        <p>
            He originally planned to serve a mission; however, like many young men at his time, those dreams were dashed
            when
            the United States entered the Korean War.
            After the war, he started attending BYU, then went to the University of Chicago Law School.
            He was very successful in his career; he was a law clerk to Chief Justice Earl Warren, a professor at
            University of
            Chicago Law School, and eventually the Dean of the Law School.
            In 1971, he was appointed the president of BYU, then he served on the Utah Supreme Court for 4 years.

            While he was a freshman at BYU, he worked at a radio station announcing High School Basketball games.
            It was during this job where he met June Dixon.
            After a year and half of dating, they married in the Salt Lake City Temple.
            She delayed her education in order to care for their children.
            They have a total of four daughters and two sons.
            She passed away on July 21, 1998 after a fierce fight with cancer.
            In 2000, Dallin H. Oaks remarried with Kristen Meredith McMain.
        </p>
        <p>
            On April 7, 1984, he was called to be a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
            On January 14, 2018, he was set apart as the First Counselor of Russell M. Nelson.
            In addition, as the most senior member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, he is their defacto president.
