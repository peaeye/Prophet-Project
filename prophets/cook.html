            Quentin L. Cook is currently the 8th Senior Apostle in the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
            He was born on September 8, 1940 in Logan, UT.
            His father was not active in the church, but his mom was.
            He was a very hard working high schooler; he was captain of the football team, senior class president, and
            part of his school's debate club.
            Although he was heavily involved in sports in high school, he never moved forward with sports in college.

            When he was 15, his brother Joe wanted to serve a mission; however, their father thought his time would be
            better spent in medical school.
            However, when Joe laid out his reason and testimony why he chose to serve a mission, his father accepted it.
            This caused Quentin to pray for guidance whether to serve a mission or not.
            He got his answer: "I received [confirmation] of the truthfulness of the Church".
            Quentin served his mission in England.
            He went to Utah State, where he obtained a bachelor's in political science.
            He then got his Doctor of Jurisprudence at Stanford.

            Him and his wife, Mary Gaddie, knew each other ever since seventh grade.
            They were good friends then, but were never really romantically involved.
            It wasn't until senior year, when they went on a double date (with different people), that they found out
            they really hit it off.
            After his mission, they got married in the Logan Temple on November 30, 1962.
            They had 3 children, 2 boys and 1 girl.
        </p>
        <p>
            On October 11, 2007, he was called to be a member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles.
